Overview
This is a web based application designed for drawing. It provides users with a canvas on which they can create various types of drawings using different tools. The application is accessible through a web browser and offers features like drawing shapes, freehand drawing, adding text, applying filters, resizing the canvas, and importing/exporting images. It aims to provide a user-friendly platform for digital artwork creation.

File Structure
The application consists of several files organised into folders. The main files include HTML files ('index.html' and 'main.html'), JavaScript files ('listener.js' and 'operations.js'), and CSS files ('style.css'). Additionally, there are folders for images ('img/') and JavaScript ('js/') files. This structured organisation helps in managing and maintaining the application codebase.

HTML Structure
The HTML files contain the structure of the application's user interface. 'index.html' serves as the entry point and contains a video background along with a button to start the drawing application. 'main.html' hosts the drawing canvas, tools, colour picker, sliders, and filter options. These HTML files provide the layout and elements necessary for users to interact with the drawing application.

JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript files ('listener.js' and 'operations.js') handle the application's functionality and behaviour. 'listener.js' manages event listeners for user interactions such as mouse clicks, movement, and button clicks. On the other hand, 'operations.js' implements the core features of the drawing application. It includes functions for drawing tools (shapes, freehand drawing), layer management, colour selection, canvas manipulation, image import/export, filter effects, and localStorage functionality for saving and loading drawings.

User Interface
The application's user interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. It provides clear tool buttons, sliders, and options for users to interact with. The interface allows users to select drawing tools, adjust settings, and create drawings with ease. The layout is organised logically, ensuring that users can find the tools and options they need without confusion.

Compatibility
The application is designed to work on modern web browsers and devices that support HTML5 and JavaScript. It is optimised for desktop and mobile devices, including touchscreen support for devices like tablets and smartphones. The application's compatibility ensures that users can access and use it across a variety of platforms and devices without any issues.

Future Improvements
There are several areas where the drawing application can be improved in the future. These include adding more drawing tools and shapes, enhancing the user interface with more visual feedback, optimising performance for smoother drawing experience, and implementing collaboration features for multiple users to work on the same canvas simultaneously. These improvements aim to enhance the overall user experience and functionality of the application.
